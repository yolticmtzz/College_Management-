 Main aim in developing a “EDA On College Management ”(EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis ) is to analyse the trend of student admission in the University Or College and to understand the student’s needs by the College Management. The Analysis can be done on many other fields like Placement, Departments which are preferred , College which are most preferred, Departments which have most placements. These analysis can be represented in the form of graphs, pie chart, line graph for easier understanding by the management and for planning the future curriculum. Furthermore the report generated can help determine which is most preferred field by student and determine whether to increase or decrease the number of seats which is one of the most important decision to be made by the College Management.
